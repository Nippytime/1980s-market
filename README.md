**1980's Market**

The 1980's Market is a site that brings a 1980s feel to trading in the Fivem. It allows players to view live markets to use to create buying and selling conditions, in a retro-style market environment. In addition to the market realism, the script has the ability to eventually support historical line charting to provide players with more insight into stock price movements over time.
